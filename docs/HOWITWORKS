Every hub hosted on the network is essentially a hosting software (like PtokaX) running 
on a system. The hub address specified in the format dchub://10.21.30.40:1234, is the ip address 
of that system along with 1234 being the specific port the hosting software is 'listening' to.

To check whether a hub is up or not, check_hub_status.py pings the specific port of the ip 
address using nmap. The ip addresses required to be pinged are provided through hublist.csv

chec_hub_status.py, after pinging all ip addresses, outputs the provided hub details and hub status 
to hubstat.md in markdown format. This markdown file is appended to the README.md file used by the 
github repostory.

The script update_hub_status.sh commits and pushes this updated README.md file to github. This may 
be automated by scheduling the execution of update_hub_status.sh as a cron job.

The generated README.md file is automatically converted by the github server to html format for 
building the webpage using the _config.yml file.
